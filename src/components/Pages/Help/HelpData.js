        question: 'How are parts priced in 360 shop?',
        answer: 'Parts are priced at a discount from OEM RRP (where available), or based on any contractual agreement we have in place with you or your work provider. The grade/condition of parts is taken into account, as well as the age of the vehicle you are enquiring about. Mechanical items are priced on an ad-hoc basis, with donor vehicle mileage dictating cost over and above any discount from OEM RRP, which may also be used in certain circumstances.'
